    <h3>
        As a child, technology always fascinated me. I was born in a time when technology was present, but it wasnâ€™t nearly as prevalent as it is today. When I was in the eighth grade, my parents gave me my first desktop, and my passion for computers only grew from that point on. I spent the next few years using sites like Codecademy and Hack This Site to learn more about computers and the applications I used. However, as I got older, it became more important to focus on the traditional, required subjects to graduate from high school and get into a good college. Homework and exam prep started piling up; I started setting aside my hobby and eventually forgot about it. Due to classes being online and the anxiety of potentially leaving my family during a pandemic, I eventually decided that my best option was to go to a local college: Murray State University. I began college as many first-year students do, unmotivated and unsure if I was making the right decision. The only thing I was certain of was that I wanted to spend my career helping people, so I set my major to pre-med. Unfortunately, my major made me miserable. I hated my classes and was underprepared for the amount of work that came with going to college.
